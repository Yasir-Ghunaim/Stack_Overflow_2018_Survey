## Installation
The code uses Python version 3 and libraries from Anaconda.

## Project Motivation
In this project, I explored couple of interesting questions based on Stack Overflow 2018 sruvery such as:
1. How do deveoplers evalute a job opportunity?
2. Do developers working in small and large companies have the same career goals?
3. Does a developer's age affect how they view AI risks?

The detailed analysis can be found in the "2018_Stack_Overflow_Survey.ipynb" file.

## Results
The analysis results are discussed in this article: https://medium.com/@yasirghunaim/how-do-developers-think-8e41ac35493a
