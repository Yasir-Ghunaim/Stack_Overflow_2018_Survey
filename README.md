## Installation
The code uses Python version 3 and libraries from Anaconda. Other than than, no installation should be required.

## Project Motivation
In this project, I explored couple of interesting questions based on Stack Overflow 2018 sruvery such as:
1. How do deveoplers evalute a job opportunity?
2. Does a developer age affect how they view AI risks?
3. Do developers working in small and large companies have the same career goals?

The analysis can be found in the "2018_Stack_Overflow_Survey.ipynb" file.
